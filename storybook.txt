This section provides detailed information on key C# language features and features accessible to C# through the .NET Framework.
Most of this section assumes that you already know something about C# and general programming concepts. If you are a complete beginner with programming or with C#, you might want to visit the C# Developer Center, where you can find many tutorials, samples and videos to help you get started.
For information about specific keywords, operators and preprocessor directives, see C# Reference. For information about the C# Language Specification, see C# Language Specification.
